# Q1. A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products. A value N printed on each product. When
# the scanner reads the value N on the item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item.
# The task is to design a software such that given the code of any item N the product(multiplication) of all the
# digits of value should be computed(price).
# Example 1:
# Input:
# 5244 -->Value of N
# Output:
# 160 -->Price
# Explanation:
# From the input above:
# Product of the digits: 5,1,4,4
# 5*2*4*4 = 160
# Hence Output is 160

n = int(input())
d = 1

for i in str(n):
    d *= int(i)

print(d)


# Q2. An event management company has come up with a unique idea of printing their event tickets. Based
# on the ticket number combination (str1), the visitor is directed towards a particular class of audience. The
# task is to create a program/application to fetch the ticket number based on the following conditions:
# Any occurrences of digits EF, 56 and G, & should be deleted
# The characters EF should be in the same format.
# Example 1:
# Input:
# 4523EF58G -> Value of STR1
# Output:
# 452358 -> After removal of characters
# ‘EF’ and ‘G’
# Example 2:
# Input:
# E12F35G58 -> Value of STR1
# Output:
# E12F3558 -> After removal of character ‘G’
# Explanation:
# In the above example, characters E and F are not together. So, they won’t be deleted. The output will be with
# only character G removal.

s = input("Enter a string: ")
i = 0

while i < len(s):
    if s[i:i+2] == 'EF':
        s = s[:i] + s[i+2:]  # Removes 'EF'
        continue  # Check the current index again
    elif s[i] == 'G':
        s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]  # Removes 'G'
        continue  # Check the current index again
    else:
        i += 1

print(s)
