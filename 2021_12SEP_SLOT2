# Q1. Airport security officials have confiscated several items of the passenger at the security checkpoint. All
# the items have been dumped into a huge box(array). Each item possessed a certain amount of risk(0,1,2).
# Here is the risk severity of the item representing an array[] of N number of integer values. The risk here is to
# sort the item based on their level of risk values range from 0 to 2.
# Example 1:
# Input:
# 7 ----- Value of N
# [1,0,2,0,1,0,2] -> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line
# Output:
# 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 -> Element after sorting based on the risk severity.
# Example 2:
# Input:
# 10 ----- Value of N
# [2,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,0] -> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line
# Output:
# 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 -> Element after sorting based on the risk severity.

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
print(' '.join(map(str, arr)))
