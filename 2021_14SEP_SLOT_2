#  *  A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here 
#  * represent an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) of 
#  * chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array). Click here to see solution
# Example 1 : N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0].
# There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array
